# Hello-world
First repository

Hello this is my first use of GitHub

I am really unsure about any of this, but it looks like a heap of fun and I can't wait to learn more and more about the programming world of IT.
I've been tinkering a bit on GitHub and possibly have a simple understanding of how it works.
